        I am Abdulla Al Farabi from Bangladesh. I was born and grew up in a small town called Narsingdi, situated just beside the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka. I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from the Bangladesh Army University of Engineering and Technology.
        
        Right after my graduation, I joined as a trainee at Alema Textile Limited (MIM Group) on 20 August 2021. Three months later, I got a promotion to assistant engineer (electrical) in dyeing production and still now I am continuing my job in this company.
        
        Along with my professional career, I am a very enthusiastic, hard-working, and dedicated person. 
        
        I believe that Perseverance, Hardworking, and dedication can bring everyone utmost success</h1>
